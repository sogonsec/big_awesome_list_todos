# Big awesome list of TODOs

This repo is a main place to keep track of things I want to work on and store in github. Mainly for learning and POC purposes.

* icmp rootkit that allows pilfering data and knocking for a shell targeting linux and freebsd
* software for nanopi r1, that allows it to be a transparent ethernet cable plant. mainly for pilfering data, hoping to find creds. It should apply multiple measures to remain invisible, which I'm not entirely sure of yet, but I thinking it should at least change the mac address to masquerade as the original machine. (a)-(b) -> (a)-(nanopi r1)-(b)
* provisioning to create labs in vmware, done as automatically as possible.
* slide decks for presentations: embracing being a scrub, learning from failure, buffer overflows, reverse engineering with ghidra, reverse engineering and binary exploitation with radare2, using gef+gdb, writing scripts for radare2
* get gud with c, write a personal port of "blackhat python" and "blackhat go" but for c
* write a command and control client and server in C and python, possibly with a with an irc bot?! 
* write N-day exploits, not for all that sweet N-day glory but to figure out the problem and write it, should be a good learning experience
* training course for hacking stuff? That's a big one, probably shouldn't be in here.
